	<h2> blocks! </h2>
	<p> blocks make up the landscape of your minecraft world and are used in many of the games mechanics. </p>
	<h4> natural-spawning blocks </h4>
	<p> naturally-spawning blocks appear on their own throughout your world and several can be used to craft other types of blocks. some examples include grass blocks, iron ore, wood logs, gravel and stone.</p>
	<h4> manufactured blocks </h4>
	<p> manufactured blocks do not appear on their own throughout the world (with some exeptions that can spawn in certain structures) and several can be used to craft other types of blocks. some examples include wood planks, slime blocks, glazed terracotta, and redstone blocks.</p>
